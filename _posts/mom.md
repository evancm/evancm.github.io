I'm excited that everyone reading Michelle Obama's book is learning about her mentor, Susan Sher, who happens to be my mom.

Here are a few of the things I've learned from my mom:

1/ Always say "nice to see you" and you don't have to worry about remembering if you've met someone before.

2/ Playing dumb can help you get more information and get people on your side.

3/ To get someone to make a certain decision, sometimes the shortest distance from A to B is not a straight line. They might need to go to C first.

4/ The most important thing in the long run is your reputation.

5/ Great work sometimes leads to impact, which sometimes leads to success, which sometimes leads to money. The important thing is to do the work.

6/ Following your interests gives you a better shot at doing great work. Being great at something you don't care about is basically impossible.

7/ Encourage your kids to follow their interests so that when they win an Oscar they'll bring you as their date (my brother is very, very classy)

8/ Eat! You look thin!

Ok she didn't directly say all these things but still, most of my beliefs are strongly influenced by her. Thanks mom.
